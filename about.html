              <p>After two years of advocacy from Greenpoint neighbors and elected officals, and after a thorough study by the DOT, the DOT has proposed a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard. The plan will:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Add a protected bike lane in each direction to protect cyclists and make the street safer for all road users</li>
                <li>Remove one lane of traffic in each direction to slow traffic and accomodate the new bike lanes</li>
                <li>Add neighborhood loading zones to faciliate local deliveries</li>
                <li>Maintain the majority of existing street parking</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We are supportive of these changes, and would like to seem them implemented as soon as possible.</p>

            <div class="container bg-light p-3 rounded">
              <p>The DOT is ready to begin implementing the redesign this summer (2023). However, despite a variety of DOT engagement over the past year; the support of thousands of Greenpoint neighbors as well as our councilmember, state senator, and state assemblyperson; the plan is now, at the 11th hour, facing serious opposition that could entirely derail it. You can read more about the opposition in publications such as <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2023/06/argento-family-mcguinness-boulevard-safety-redesign.html">Curbed</a> and <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/6/13/23759703/keep-mcguinness-moving-greenpoint-broadway-stages-gina-argento">The City</a>, as well as from our Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtUYSYbOvkG/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctebwc3uyYR/">here</a>).
              <p>We need to show the Mayor's office that Greenpoint is firmly in support of a redesigned McGuinness, where residents, visitors, and workers can walk, bike and drive safely.

                 The redesign will actually help in facilitating deliveries by including dedicated loading zones on every block for small businesses to use. In NYC, loading zones have reduced double-parking by up to 70%. Neighborhood loading zones cut the time that commercial drivers spend looking for parking. This also reduces air pollution, noise, and fuel consumption.

                  It will not! Currently, McGuinness traffic consists of 30% to 50% cut-thru traffic, mainly from drivers seeking a shortcut between the Long Island Expressway and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. By removing lanes from McGuinness, the new design disincentivizes drivers from leaving the highway to use McGuinness as a shortcut. This helps clear up the traffic for neighbors running errands and businesses getting deliveries.

                  NYC streets that have received road diets and bike lanes have seen a major boost in sales.

                  Balancing the space on McGuinness to accommodate all road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers) while adding loading zones and preserving parking will make local businesses all around the boulevard more accessible for more people.

                  The redesign will not impede emergency vehicles. All DOT changes are approved by the FDNY. The new bike lanes will be accessible to emergency vehicles should they need it, effectively allowing them to bypass any traffic on the boulevard (an improvement from the current design).
                  <p>Although there are some signs on McGuinness indicating it's an evacuation route, specific evacuation routes are no longer in use by NYC. Should an evacuation be necessary, residents will still be able to use the boulevard on foot, by vehicle, or by bicycle.</p>
